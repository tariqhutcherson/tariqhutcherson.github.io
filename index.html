      <p class="time"><em>"Momma, you've been an anchor in my life. You and I've seen many trials, some of which weren't our fault. In the midst of the confusion of my teenage years and the chaos of my early adult years, you've always been a safe space for me to fall down and get back up. They say it takes a village, and I'm fortunate that my village includes you. You've overcame a lot and served as an inspiration for me to keep going. I love you very much."</em> -Tariq</p>
